Soccer Pong

Prescribed Changes #1 New Assets
-New Graphics added for the background, the ball, the bat.
	- The background is now a soccer field
	- The ball is now a soccer ball
	- The bat is now a soccer person
-New fonts and sounds were added to the game. There are sounds now when the ball bounces off the sides of the screen and
player. There is also a sound when you lose and life as while as when you gain a life.
-The view should ensure scaling of my game to different screen. This was tested on mutiple different screens and it works
with no issues

Prescribed Change #2 Change of Perspective
-The bat will now move vertically, up and down. It can also move left to right. I changed it also so the bat can not go fully
off screen like in the orginal game.
-The ball now moves horizanlly left to right. The out of bounce area is now the right side of the screen and the ball
will bounce off the top, left, and bottom of the screen. You will get more point when the ball hits the left side
of the screen

Changes #3: Discrentionary Changes: Rebound, Rewards, Special Ability, and Drag
#1. Rebound: Now when the player hits the soccer ball, the ball will gain a slight speed boost in speed. The speed resets
back to normal when the player runs out of lives.
#2. Rewards: The player will now gain a life when they keep the ball going every 30 seconds. A timer was added to the
bottom right corner to show when the player will get their next life.
#3. Special Ability; The player can use the "S" key to slow down the ball for 5 seconds. They can only use this ability once
per game. The ball will slow down to 5 seconds and then the speed will be reset back to normal begining of game speed.
#4. Drag: The ball will now slowly slown down as it travels and lose momentum. When the ball is moving very slowly, it
will reset, causing the player to lose a life.
