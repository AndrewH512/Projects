Zombie Arena Variation

Prescribed Change #1
- There are now randomly placed, static obstacles (walls) in the arena. But players and zombies cannot pass through them.
- Added a obstacles sprite
- Zombies will not get stuck on them, they will go around the obstacle
- The obstacle shouldn't spawn on the player anymore.

Prescribed Change #2
- Multi-shot is now a new pickup in the game. When the player runs over the gun on the ground, they will reseive a multi-shot
power up. This power up shoots two bullets in two different directions.

Prescribed Change #3
- Now each time the crawler gets hit, it's speed will increase slightly

Discretionary Changes
More Enemy Behaviors (2)
- Chasers now have 2 health. When they are hit now, they will stop chasing the player and flee for 1 second before resuming 
the chase.
- Bloaters now when they get hit, will stop or get stunned for 1 second, and then their speeds will increase very slightly.

Cosmetic Effects (1)
- Added more sounds into the game.
	- There is now music that is played in the background of both the paused menus and while playing the game. The music
	  will play in a loop and will never stop. The music reset for each level and for everytime you go back to the
	  paused menu or the leveling up menu.
	- There is now a zombie and player death sound added. The player will also make a sound when they are on half
	  health
	- There is different sounds for all 6 pickups in the game
- Added a new background image in the paused and leveling up menu
- Added a Title to the main menu of the game
- Changed the colors of the font to better match the feel of the game (Red and Green)

Additional Player Upgrade (1)
- Added a score pickup upgrade for the play. Now we the play runs over the little plus sign, their score will double. I also added
a negative score pickup. This will decrease their score by half if they run over the little minus sign. This is to balance out the
double score, because I was getting really high scores because of it. Now there is a pickup thats not fully postive for
the player. 

Additional Changes that wasn't required
- I also added a speed upgrade for the player, this will increase their speed when their run over the little boots. I know
this upgrade won't count toward a grade, I just did it for fun.
