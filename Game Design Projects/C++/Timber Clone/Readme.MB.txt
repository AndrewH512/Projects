Apple Dodge!!! - A Timber Edit

Spirtes, Sounds, Background:
For the sprites an background I went for more of a cartoon or fun look. I think having
a minatour, dodge apples in a forest looks fun. Same with the sounds, I tried to go for a more, cartoon feel to the
game. Added birds into the background instead of clouds.

Resolution:
The game should properly fill the screen regardless of native screen resolution. I test this on both laptop
and destop, which have differetn screen resolutions and it works great.

Changes
1.Three Postions: The player can now move in three spots. Using the down arrow key, a play can now move in the middle.
Apples will now spawn in the middle as a result of this.

2.Ambient Object Behavior: The beahvior of the abmient objects has also been changed. They move a more random speed,
come from mutiple different directions randomly, they come from different angles etc. An example would be the clounds can 
move right to left and left to right randomly. The bee can now move right to left, right to left, and diagonally!

3.Special Ability!!!: The player can hit the "I" key and gain invinciblity for 5 seconds. Player can only use once a
game because if they could use it more, it would make the game too easy.

4.Dynamic Difficulty: As the game progress, it will get harder, more apples will spawn. Also to make is eaiser for players
struggling. If a player dies 3 times, while under score 50, less branches will spawn. If the player contunines to die,
under score 50 after dieing 3 times, it will get easier. If the player is able to reach over 100 score,
the difficulty wil be rest back to normal.
