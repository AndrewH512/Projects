Edits to Dodge The Creeps

New Name: Dodge The Ships

Background
- Changed the background from a solid green color to a texture of stars. I feel this overall makes the
game look better

Text and Font Changes
- Changed the colors of the text from white to green and red. Changed the font to better match the theme

Player Edits
- Adjusted player speed from 400 ---> 300. I felt like 400 speed was too fast and I was getting high scores easily,
so the played speed is slowed down to make the game a little harder
- Changed the sprite to a blue ship.
- Change the size of the sprite to be bigger and better fit the screen
- Changed the hitbox to a rectangle shape.

Mob Edits
- Changed the enemey's to ships that are red, green and orange. 
- Changed the size of the images to better fit the screen.
- Changed the hitbox to a rectangle shape.

Controller
- Ninentdo Switch Controllers will work with this game.
