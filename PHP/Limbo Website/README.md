Limbo

This is a website project I developed in software programming two. We used PHP, html, sql and css to create this
website. The purpose of the website was to create a website that can used to report lost items. You can add items
to the database as well as claim that an item has been found or claimed. There is also an admin login where then
you can manual change the information that is stored in the database. 

Here is a youtube video showing everything the website can do:
