These are projects that I've worked on in Computer Graphics using Python, Glut and OpenGL.

3D Image of A Person Sitting on a Cube
	This project's goal was to create a 3D image of a person, sitting on a cube. Using
	the cMode13.py file.
Five Pointed Star
	The purpose of this project was to create a function that will draw a five-point star. 
	A star of size 1 should fit inside a circle with a radius of 1.
N-Sided, Arbitrary, Wireframe Polygon
	This purpose of this project was to program that allow the user to draw an n-sided, arbitrary, 
	wireframe polygon. The program allows user to draw said polygon by clicking on each vertex' 
	position, in order. The polygon is completed by clicking on the location of the first vertex.
	The program does show the user the current state of the polygon as it's being drawn
Polka Dot Texture on a Cube
	The purpose of this program was to program that will create a polka dot texture,
	and then apply the texture to a 3D cube.
Pyramid
	This project's goal was to create a function that will draw a pyramid,  whichs includes the
	appropriate u,v values for each vertex.
